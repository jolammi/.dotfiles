# -------------------50------------------------->----------72--------->
# Make two line commits. The first line should be a continuation for "If applied, this commit will ..."
# e.g. If applied, this commit will remove deprecated methods
#
# Aim for 50 chars in the subject line, 72 chars is the hard limit.
# Body (lines following the subject line) should be wrapped at 72 characters.
#
# Remember to separate subject line and body with one empty line.
#
# In the body, just focus on making clear the reasons why you made the change in the first placeâ€”the way things worked before
# the change (and what was wrong with that), the way they work now, and why you decided to solve it the way you did.
